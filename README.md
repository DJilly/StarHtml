# README

This document contains some basic instructions for how to interact with this project

Star is a simple 3 page website, but includes many of the most important elements of the HTML language. This assignment is individual, so you cannot collaborate with another student to complete this project.

Your task is to convert the provided text into valid HTML pages. Evaluate the text files and review the screenshots of all three pages. Determine, to the best of your ability how to markup the elements to create a valid HTML document.

At the end of this assignment, you should have three pages linked together by navigation. Take a look at the screen shots and the source text files.

This activity includes starter files for the three HTML pages, index.html, characters.html, and season_one.html. Download the following source folder and unpack it. In the unzipped folder, you will find the starter files and assets.

This project does not include solution files.

## Solution Files
This project doesn't include solution files.

## Resources
The resources folder contains files designed to help you complete the activity. This will include screen shots of the completed HTML and files containing the text.

### Screen Shots
Screen shots of the final code are provided for reference. Feel free to compare your rendered code with the screen shots as you work. When you render your code, it should (generally) resemble the screen shots.

NOTES: You may want to resize the width of your browser to roughly match the screen shot

### Text Files
Additionally, the text for each page is provided so that you don't have to type it word by word from the screen shots. Some pages may include images. URLs for the images are provided in the text files.
